This file consists of a Java console application that models a Grade Point Average (GPA) calculator and prints the result.

It uses the following grading system to grade scores dynamically:

Score    Grade       Point   Remark

70-100     A           5      Excellent

60-69       B          4       Very Good

50-59       C          3       Good

45-49       D          2       Fair

40-44       E          1       Pass

0-39         F          0       Fail

Given Task Story:

As a User, I want to be able to input course name and code, course unit, course score; one after the other 

so that the calculator will calculate the score grade and record it before the total result and GPA is displayed.
